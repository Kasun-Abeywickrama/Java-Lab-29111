<h3>Question</h3>

Code for the last example that we have discussed during the class.

 We need the following Output. (Use Netbeans code generation option where necessary)

Employee Name: xxxxx (Use setter to set and getter to retrieve)
Basic Salary: xxxx (Use setter to set and getter to retrieve)
Bonus: xxxx (You may use the constructor to pass this value)
Bonus Amount: xxxxx (Develop a separate method to calculate Bonus amount. Bonus amount is the total of Bonus and Basic Salary)
