<h3>Question</h3>


The Volume of a Cylinder can be found with the following formula: 
                
Volume = PI * Radius*Radius*Height    where PI=3.14159 
 
It is required to map the above class diagram to Java code. 

Note: Container is an abstract class.
        Height & Radius are private variables 
        All the methods are public
  
(i)	Write down the Java definition of class container  
(ii)	Write the Java Definition of class CylindricalContainer. (Implement the Methods)
(iii)	Create an object from CylindricalContainer and display the volume.
