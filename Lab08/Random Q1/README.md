<h3>Question :</h3>
    
Create a class named "BankAccount" with private instance variables "accountNumber" and "balance". Implement Encapsulation by providing public getter and setter methods for both variables. Additionally, create an abstract method called "calculateInterest" in the "BankAccount" class. Implements two subclasses, "SavingsAccount" and "CheckingAccounts". that extend the "BankAccount" class and provide their own implementations of the "calculatInterest" method. write the implementation code for the setter and getter methods in the "BankAccount" class and the "calculateInterest" method in both the "SavingsAccount" and "CheckingAccount" classes. Assuming that the interest for savings is 12% and checking is 2% (both private variables), find out what will be the interest for a person with 1 million in his checking and 20 million in his savings account.
